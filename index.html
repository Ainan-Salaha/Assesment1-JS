        <h1>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h1>
        <p>Both are comparison operators and they return boolean values always. The difference
            between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas “ === “ is
            used to compare both value and datatype.</p>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
            var a = 10;
            var b = '10';
            console.log(a == b) //true
            console.log(a === b) //false
        </pre>
        
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>2.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h1>
        <p>
            var is a global scoped means variables created using var keyword will be accessible globally. It
            can be redeclared and reinitialized.<br>
            var a = 10;<br>
            let is a block scoped means variables created using let keyword will be accessible only in that
            specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.<br>
            let a = 20;<br>
            const is also block scoped means variables created using const keyword will be accessible only
            in that specific block where it has been declared. It cannot be redeclared and cannot be
            reinitialized.<br>
            const a = 30;
        </p>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>3.What is hoisting?</h1>
        <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
            top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations,
            not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting. Let and const keywords are
            not hoisted so when you try to access them before initialization they start giving you Reference
            error.</p>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
                console.log(message); //output : undefined
                var message = 'The variable Has been hoisted'
        </pre>

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>

        <h1>4.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h1>
        <p>The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable
            with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const
            variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when
            that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the
            temporal dead zone.</p>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
            function somemethod() {
                console.log(counter1); // undefined
                console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
                var counter1 = 1;
                let counter2 = 2;
                }                
        </pre>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>5.What is execution context</h1>
        <p>Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
            Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.<br>
            JS engine uses a Call stack and also creates a special environment to handle the execution of
            the JavaScript code. This environment is known as the <b>Execution Context</b>.<br>
            The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in
            its execution.<br>
            During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables
            and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets
            executed.<br>
            There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:<br>
            ● Global Execution Context (GEC)<br>
            ● Function Execution Context (FEC)<br>
            The moment code gets executed GEC gets created and gets pushed to Call Stack. Inside the
            global or functional execution context, there are two phases : Memory allocation (Creation
            Phase) and Code execution (Execution Phase).<br>
            Inside Memory allocation, the variables declared using var keyword get memory allocated as
            undefined in global scope and variables declared using let or const gets their memory allocated
            as undefined in block scope<br>
            That is the reason why we can access the variables before initialization declared using var, it
            will give undefined.<br>
            But if we will try to access the variables using let const before their initialization then it will
            give Reference Error because these variables will be in block scope and can not be accessed
            until unless they are not initialized. This is also known as temporal dead zone.
            Whereas, functions gets memory allocated as their actual value defined in code. Inside Code
            Execution, variables will get their actual value assigned to them. And functions will create a
            functional execution context.<br>
            The moment this FEC will be created, it will be pushed to Call stack and once the execution of
            the function is over then this FEC will be removed from the call stack and the point of
            execution will again be moved to GEC.
        </p>
 <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>

        <h1>6.What is an event loop and call stack</h1>
        <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser)
            to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently
            being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it
            stores global execution context and function execution context.<br>
            The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the
            call stack. All the web apis functions like setTimeout, setInterval, fetch calls etc. will not be
            directly executed inside the execution context, firstly they will be moved to callback queue and
            then the moment call stack gets empty these functions will be pushed to call stack from
            callback queue by event loop.<br>
            If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function
            from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen</p>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>

        <h1>7.What is creation phase and execution phase?</h1>
        <p>Compiler runs through the entire code for 2 time before actually executing the code, and
            generates a Global Execution context , inside this we have two phases creation phase and
            execution phase<br>
        <pre>
                <b>Creation Phase</b>
                1. In the first run, It picks all function declarations and stores them in memory with
                their reference.
                2. In the second run, It picks all variables and assign undefined to them. In the event of
                a conflict between variable and function declaration name then that variable is
                ignored.
                <b>Execution Phase</b>
                1. Variables assigned with values given in code at the time of initialization.
                2. Functions executed</pre>
        </p>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>

        <h1>8.What are callbacks?</h1>
        <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is
            invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to
            use callback function<br>
        </p>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example
                function callbackFunction(name) {
                    console.log('Hello ' + name);
                    }
                    function outerFunction(callback) {
                    let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
                    callback(name);
                    }
                    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
            </pre>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>9.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h1>
        <p>These all three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object
            as first argument and at the time of definition we don't have mention this object as a parameter
            and we can access the values of object by using this keyword in function definition.<br>

            <b>call():</b> The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest
            of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.
        </p>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
                    var emp1={
                        name:"John",
                        age:21
                        }
                        var emp2={
                        name:"Smith",
                        age:22
                        }
                        function invite(greeting1,greeting2){
                        console.log(greeting1+" "+this.name+" "+greeting2)
                        }
                        invite.call(emp1,"Hi","How are you!")
                        Output: Hi John How are you!
                </pre>

        <p>
            <b>apply():</b> The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and
            rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
                    invite.apply(emp2,["hey dude," ,"how are you!"])
                    Output: hey dude, Smith how are you!
                    </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> bind():</b> The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference
            of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can
            use it by passing rest of the arguments.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
            var inviteEmployee1=invite.bind(emp1);
            var inviteEmployee2=invite.bind(emp2);
            inviteEmploye1("hi","how are you")
            inviteEmploye2("hey","how are you doing?")
            Output:
            hi John how are you
            hey Smith how are you doing?
        </pre>
        </p>
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>10.What is meant by first class functions</h1>
        <p>A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language
            are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as
            an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a
            value to a variable.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">
            1. Example | Assign a function to a variable
            const temp = function() {
            console.log("Hello World !!");
            }
            temp();
            Output: Hello World !!
        </pre>
        We assigned an Anonymous Function in a Variable, then we used that variable to invoke the
        function by adding parentheses () at the end.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">
            2. Example | Pass a function as an Argument
            function sayHello() {
            return "Hello, ";
            }
            function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
            console.log(helloMessage() + name);
            }
            // Pass “sayHello” function as an argument to “greeting” function
            greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
            Output: Hello, JavaScript!
        </pre>
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">
            3. Example | Return a function
            function sayHello() {
            return function add() {
            console.log("Hello!");
            }
            }
        </pre>
        In this example; We need to return “add” function from another function so add function will
        be first class function. We can return a function because we treated function in JavaScript as a
        value.
        </p>        
        
<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>

        <h1>11.What is the spread operator?</h1>
        The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like
        arrays and objects to access the elements individually.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
            const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
            const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
            const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
            console.log(numbersCombined)
            Output:
            [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        </pre>

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">**************************************************************************************************************************</h2>
        <h1>12.What are pure functions?</h1>
        <p>Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same
            arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state, or data change during a program’s
            execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.
        <pre style="color: brown; font-size: 1rem;">Example:
                function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
                return productPrice * 0.05;
                }
        </pre>
            The above function will always return the same result, if we pass the same productPrice. In
            other words, it’s output doesn’t get effected by any other values / state changes. So we can call
            “calculateGST” function as a Pure function.</p>
